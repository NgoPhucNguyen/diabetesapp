- Tooltip 

{tooltip && <Tooltip text={tooltip} position="top" />}


A Plot.jsx (page) having these features :
- Users could choose what plots they want 
- Option is already there, like showing picture 
- the plot will render by R code ( I don't have R code yet so how can I call API with R and React ?)
- (Add later : people could choose each features (based on specific plot))
- Like heatmap is can choose 21 features
- Barplot cannot choose features that binary
- Or Binary features what can plot some what. Like a search
- A plot have tags : 1. Whats are features ? 2. What kind of plots 3. Plots show what 
- A plot-container (or card) will have a picture of plots, description and what plots is talk about?
